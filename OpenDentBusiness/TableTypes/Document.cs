//Old scheme was (working backward, of course):
//1.Start at UL of image
//2.Apply clip using image coordinates
//3.Translate through a series of steps to the center of the crop area
//4.Rotate
//5.Translate to the center of screen or mount item
//This won't work going forward because all the images would be crooked.
//Final cropped version needs to have vertical and horizontal edges, especially for mounts.
//New crop scheme:
//1.Start at UL of image
//2.Translate from UL of image to center of image
//3.Rotate
//4.Scale
//5.Translate from center of image to center of crop area
//6.Apply clip
//7.Translate to center of screen or mount item.
//So this requires a conversion of existing crop scheme to new crop scheme.
//Used a test database of version 21.3, with all possible combinations, and then converted and it looks the same.
