	///<summary>Jordan 6/5/2022 This class only exists because of the shortcomings of the old ODProgress.cs.
	///Once that progress bar is gone, we can remove this class also.
	///Purposefully overrides or hides System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox from any extending namespace.
	///This is so that we can inject our own code prior to System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox.Show().
	///This is necessary when a separate thread has UI and the owner thread needs to show a message box.
	///The idea behind this class is for any project to create its own MessageBox class that simply extends this one.
	///This will successfully hide System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox for the entire namespace of the extending class.
	///E.g. see OpenDental.MessageBox for more details.
	///Side note: Visual Studio may suggest simplifying MessageBox.Show() to ODMessageBox.Show().  Do not do this.  Either ignore the suggestion
	///or go remove the suggestion entirely in the Visual Studio settings.  To remove this suggestion from the OpenDental project...

	///Once the ruleset editor is open, search for IDE0002 and uncheck the check box > Save (a warning will show about making a new file).</summary>
