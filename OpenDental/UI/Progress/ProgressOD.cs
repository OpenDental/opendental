/*
Example, Simple======================================================================================================================
			UI.ProgressOD progressOD=new UI.ProgressOD();
			progressOD.ActionMain=() => ;
			progressOD.ShowDialogProgress();
			if(progressOD.IsCancelled){
				return;
			}

Example, Complex=====================================================================================================================
(Obviously, you wouldn't normally use all of these.  Pick and choose.)
ProgressOD progressOD=new ProgressOD();
progressOD.ActionMain=DoThings;
progressOD.ProgStyle=ProgressBarStyle.Blocks;//marquee is more popular because it requires less programming effort.
progressOD.StartingMessage=Lan.g(this,"Please wait while we do things.");
progressOD.TypeEvent=typeof(SomeEvent);
progressOD.ODEventTypeMy=ODEventType.SomeType;
try{
	progressOD.ShowDialogProgress();
}
catch(Exception ex){
	MyExceptionHandler(ex,this);
	//usually, it's best to just return here instead of checking IsSuccess further down
}
if(progressOD.IsCancelled){
	return;//or similar to gracefully handle when they click Cancel
}
//do any cleanup that should be done regardless of an exception
return progressOD.IsSuccess;//If the calling class wants to know if success, for example.

Example Chained Series with common log=======================================================================================================
//this pattern will probably not be used much, but it could come in handy.
ProgressOD progressOD=new ProgressOD();
progressOD.HasHistory=true;
progressOD.HistoryClose=true;
progressOD.ActionMain=() => { 
	ProgressBarEvent.Fire(ODEventType.ProgressBar,"Doing first thing");
	//do something
};
progressOD.ShowDialogProgress();
if(progressOD.IsCancelled){
	return;
}
string progressMsg=progressOD.HistoryMsg;
//some intermittent code here, which is why we didn't just have one progress bar in the first place.
progressOD=new ProgressOD();
progressOD.HasHistory=true;
progressOD.HistoryMsg=progressMsg;
progressOD.ActionMain=() => { 
	ProgressBarEvent.Fire(ODEventType.ProgressBar,"Doing second thing");
	//do something
};
//dlg will not close here because HistoryClose is not set true
progressOD.ShowDialogProgress();
if(progressOD.IsCancelled){
	return;
}	

Events==============================================================================================================================
Inside of your background thread, you can fire global events:
MiscDataEvent.Fire(ODEventType.MiscData,"Done with step "+i.ToString());
or
ProgressBarHelper progressBarHelper=new ProgressBarHelper("Done with step "+i.ToString(),blockValue:i,blockMax:100);
ProgressBarEvent.Fire(ODEventType.ProgressBar,progressBarHelper);

General Guidelines======================================================================================================
There are two main considerations: 
1. Handle Cancel (described in examples above). This is a new feature that the old progress bar did not have.
2. Shrink the scope (discussed below).
The old progress bar is probably including far too much code within the action. This is a bad pattern.  
The first step is usually to identify the smallest and slowest section of code, usually one line.
This very small section of code should not include any UI.
If it makes a call to a method, you must examine all of the code in that method to ensure it contains no UI.
Once you've identified the line that needs to be wrapped, you can proceed to code for the new progress bar and remove the old one.
If UI code is intermingled with code that requires a progress bar, then you may end up with a few more progress bars.
They don't need to be chained together, as in the example above.  They can simply be a series of individual progress bars.
A series of progress bars is not at all annoying, as long as they each automatically close on their own.
Use wait cursors for everything else:
-if the wait is generally under 5 seconds
-You want to completely lock the user out (of a short action) because the action is impossible to clean up if cancelled.
-UI manipulation and dialogs.
