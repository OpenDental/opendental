Open Dental Software, Inc distributes and supports this software through authorized purchase.  A Registration Key is provided to purchaser at time of sale and is valid for exactly one physical location where patients are treated.  Each separate physical location where patients are treated requires a separate purchase and Registration Key.  Mobile treatment units are each treated as one physical location.  Purchaser may install this software on any number of computers or devices at a single dental office.   Purchaser may also install this software at any number of other locations as long as patients are not treated at those locations.  For example, home use is allowed without additional purchase.  Software updates as part of a monthly support plan are considered to be purchases as well, with all authorized updates delivered via a particular Registration Key becoming part of the purchased software.  Multiple offices may not share a single support plan. 
Different or additional licensing terms may be provided to institutional, enterprise, and other users.
