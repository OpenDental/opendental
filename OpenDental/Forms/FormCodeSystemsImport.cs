Users shall not change the content or structure of the LOINC document ontology file or the LOINC panels and forms from the LOINC panels and forms file, but may notify the Regenstrief Institute of any potential inconsistencies or corrections needed by contacting loinc@regenstrief.org.
5. A user may delete records from the LOINC table to deal with the user's local requirements. A user also may add new records to the LOINC table to deal with the users' local requirements, provided that if new records are added, any new entry in the LOINC_NUM field of such new records must contain a leading alphabetic ""X"" so that the new codes and records cannot be confused with existing LOINC codes or new LOINC codes as they are defined in later releases of the LOINC table. Records deleted or added by users to deal with local requirements are not reflected in the official LOINC table maintained by the Regenstrief Institute and the LOINC Committee. Users must also make reasonable efforts to submit requests to LOINC for new records to cover observations that are not found in the LOINC table in order to minimize the need for X-codes.
6. LOINC codes and other information from the LOINC table may be used in electronic messages for laboratory test results and clinical observations such as HL7 ORU messages, without the need to include this Copyright Notice and License or a reference thereto in the message (and without the need to include all fields required by Section 8 hereof). When the LOINC code (from the LOINC_NUM field) is included in the message, users are encouraged, but not required, to include the corresponding LOINC short name (from the SHORTNAME field) or the LOINC long common name (from the LONG_COMMON_NAME field) in the message if the message provides a place for a text name representation of the code. 
7. Users may make and distribute an unlimited number of copies of the Licensed Materials. Each copy thereof must include this Copyright Notice and License, and must include the appropriate version number of the Licensed Materials if the Licensed Materials have a version number, or the release date if the Licensed Materials do not have a version number.

Notice of Third Party Content and Copyright Terms
A small portion of the content of the LOINC table, LOINC panels and forms file, LOINC document ontology file, LOINC hierarchies file, RELMA database and associated search index files consists of content subject to copyright from third parties. This third party content is either used with permission or under the applicable terms of use. In all such cases, we have included the copyright notice. The copyright of the LOINC codes per se remain owned by Regenstrief Institute, Inc. and the LOINC Committee and subject to the LOINC Copyright Notice and License.
The third party content is identified in the LOINC table by the applicable copyright notice (up to 250 characters) stored in the EXTERNAL_COPYRIGHT_NOTICE field. In RELMA and our web-based search application (http://search.loinc.org), the third party content is highlighted as follows: When such content appears in a search result grid, the programs will display a field with a link to a page containing the copyright notice and terms of use for that content. The programs may also visually highlight the rows of these LOINC codes.
We have included third party content that allows use and distribution at least for clinical, administrative, and research purposes. The third party copyright owners generally ask for attribution of the source, allow the free use of the content for treatment, health care management, and research purposes. They generally forbid alteration of their content (e.g., survey questions and/or answers) and use for commercial purpose, which usually means the direct sale of the survey instruments. They often do allow use of their content in commercial software, medical record and other clinical database systems, and the messaging of patient information collected through the use of these instruments.";
